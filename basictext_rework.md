This is a fully functional text editor!
It's very primitive, but it works!

If I was stupid enough, I could probably write Markdown in this.
For the funny, that is exactly what I'll do now.

# How to use BasicEdit
Basicedit has a few commands to keep in mind. These include:
- g: for going to a specific line
- e: for re-entering edit mode
- s: for saving the current file
- o: for opening a file
- x: for exiting the application
